The [SSE Hydro](https://www.thessehydro.com/whats-on) is a major events arena in Glasgow, Scotland, UK, holding [up to 13,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE_Hydro).

For many people and businesses nearby, it would be really useful if there was some sort of app or website they could check to see if there was something on that night, and what it was.

From this thought, the first version of https://whatsonatthehydrotonight.com was born.

Shout outs for inspiration go to:

-   [Taps Aff or Taps Oan?](http://www.taps-aff.co.uk)
-   [HowLongHasNorthernIrelandNotHadAGovernment.com](https://howlonghasnorthernirelandnothadagovernment.com)

The site is currently running happily and quickly on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). They didn't pay me to say that, I just think it's awesome.
